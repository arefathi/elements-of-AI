# Introduction

###### What is **Artificial Intelligence** (AI)? Will a robot take my job? How is artificial intelligence likely to change human's job in the next ten year's? Where are AI technologies being used right now and where will they come next?

#### How should we define AI?
-----------------------------

Three applications of AI that illustrate different aspects of AI.
> 1. Self-driving Cars
> 2. Content recommendation
> 3. Image and video processing
 
AI is a scientific discipline, like mathematics or biology. This means that AI is a collection of concepts, problems, and methods for solving them. Avoid saying "an AI", and instead say "an AI method"


#### Related Fields
---------------------
Related topics include Machine Learning, data science, and deep learning.
> 1. Machine Learning - subfield of AI, which itself is a subfield of computer science. Machine learning enables AI solutions that are adaptive
> 2. Deep Learning - subfield of machine learning, which itself is a subfield of AI, which itself is a subfield of computer science.
> 3. Data Science - includes machine learning and statistics, certain aspects of computer science including algorithms, data storage, and web application development
> 4. Robotics - means building and programming robots so that they can operate in complex, real-world scenarios. It is considered ultimate challenge of AI since it requires a combination of virtually all areas of AI.
